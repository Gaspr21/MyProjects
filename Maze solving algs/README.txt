To run the program you will need open ports on 8080 and 3000.
Assuming you already have go installed and have worked on things like these.

1. Run the go files with:
` go run . `
to start all the go files.
Always run backend first so that the socket connection is established correctly.

2. Run the react app
` npm start `

Thats it.
