## Welcome to my projects 
This repo was mainly made for projects i wanted / want to work on and for expanding my knowledge in things i find interest in.
For now there is only one project... as you can see. I am planning to populate it more in the near future.

P.S. Before you start running my code you should read the [README](MazeSolvingAlgs/README.md)
files in the viewing folder, ofcourse if u want the code to run properly.
