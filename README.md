## Welcome to my projects 

This is where I store all of my projects. Some projects are not complete... as you can see. 
This repo was mainly made for projects i wanted / want to work on and for expanding my knowledge.

P.S. Before you start running my code you should read the README files in the viewing folder, ofcourse if u want the code to run properly.
