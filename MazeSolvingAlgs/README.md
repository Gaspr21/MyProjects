To run the program you will need open ports on 8080 and 3000.

Assuming you already have go installed and have worked on things like these.

1.Installation
`npm install` to load all the dependencies

2. Run the go files with:
` go run . `
to start all the go files.
Always run backend first so that the socket connection is established correctly.

3. Run the react app
` npm start `

Thats it.

To containerize react app and go server read [README](my-app/README.Docker.md)

P.S.: The project has not yet been completed. Work in progress.
